    <h1>Lecso</h1>

    <p> Hungarian lecsó (LEH-choh) is a vegetable stew that combines three of Hungary's favorite ingredients—peppers, tomatoes, and paprika. Hungary's national spice is paprika, so you will see it in their cuisine, especially in stews and goulashes. Lecsó can be served variously as a vegetable side dish, appetizer, or the main meal itself (see the variations below). Many cooks preserve lecsó by processing it in a hot water bath to be used in the winter months. It's similar to Serbian djuvece, Russian letcho, and French ratatouille. </p>
